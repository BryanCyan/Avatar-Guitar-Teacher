3D Rhythm Guitar Performance Expert System

The Avatar Guitar Teacher is a 3D simulation designed to teach rhythm guitar performance by example. The goal is to show how a rhythm guitar player combines music "facts" about guitar chords and music "rules" about guitar rhythms - to actually play songs as a rhythm guitarist.  Players will be able to search for, create and share  chords, rhythms and songs.

Navigation:

1. Left-click on a hand to select its camera to view it full-screen.
2. Orbit around a selected hand with left-click & drag on both mouse axes.
3. Zoom in and out from a selected hand with scroll-wheel click & drag on the vertical axis.
4. Double-click on a a hand to split the screen into two windows.
5. Left-click on a hand in split-screen mode to select its camera to view it full-screen again.

Here are the next steps:

6. Right-click then "mouse-over" a "hand", then "mouse-up" over the hand to set the mouse to "move camera" mode. UI control for this also, soon.
7. Right-click then "mouse-over" the "guitar strings", then "mouse-up" over the guitar strings to set the mouse to "play guitar" mode. UI control for this also, soon.
8. Left-click on a guitar string to play its note at that fret location.
9. Right-click & drag over the guitar strings to strum the guitar with the current chord.
10. Get the guitar playing the correct notes at all string-fret locations with user click & drag.
11. Build a chord "lead sheet" and enter the chords needed to "compose" a test tune called "Freight Train".
12. Analyze and "code" the rules commonly used to play guitar chords with this rhythm style.
13. Determine "if" the lead sheet chords "can" be played with a test finger-picking rhythm called "Travis Picking".
14. List the various ways the "playable"chords can be played with this style.
15. Suggest other chord "types" and other chord "voicings" that will also work with this style. 
16. "Choreograph" the actions of the  "guitar music" sequencer and the "chord hand shape" sequencer to play the song by smoothly "shaping" the guitar chords as the tune is playing.
17. Include the actions of the "rhythm hand shape" sequencer to "animate" the actions of the rhythm hand to show it finger-picking the guitar chords.
